### Navigation
---
`Page`
<br>
an immutable object used to set the navigatorâ€™s history stack.

`Router` 
<br>
configures the list of pages to be displayed by the Navigator. Usually this list of pages changes based on the underlying platform, or on the state of the app changing.

`RouteInformationParser`
<br>
takes the RouteInformation from RouteInformationProvider and parses it into a user-defined data type.
   
`RouterDelegate`
<br>
defines app-specific behavior of how the Router learns about changes in app state and how it responds to them. Its job is to listen to the `RouteInformationParser` and the app state and build the Navigator with the current list of Pages.
